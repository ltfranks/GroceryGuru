The mongodb api isnt working on vercel as i couldnt figure it out. It does work locally.

- Login page is buggy when you click "login". So click back to the home page for the main functionality.
- On the "Recipe Search", you can click search and all recipes will pop up.
  I like to search for "cookie" recipes and look at the different ones.

- Home page grocery search by default finds the cheapest grocery for you.
- If you want something specific -> to be specific (instead of milk, search almond milk).
